### *Steps to follow when starting a new component:*
1. When starting a new component, `git checkout master` then  `git pull`
2. `git checkout -b "<component-name>"`
3. Make changes.
4. `git add .`
5. `git commit -m "<message>"`
6. `git push` (The first time you do this, it will tell you to run with some options, just paste and run that command).
6. Repeat from step 3 until you're done with the component.
7. Make a pull request on GitHub.
8. Someone else reviews the PR, if no changes required then approve and merge it.
9. Back to step 1.
